HACK BI Recipe Finder Project

Made by: Micah Abalahin, Davis Nguyen, Quincy Scanlon

--Purpose--

The purpose of this program is to allow users to get a recipe based on ingedients they select.

--Function--

This program primarily uses customtkinter (a version of tkinter) to power its user interface. It makes use of frames to redirect the user to a different screen based on what they click. 
In the selection screens, the user can select what types of ingredients they want in their meal and our program will then suggest a recipe based on their choices.

--AI Usage--

We used [Google Gemini 3 Fast] on this project to assist us with learning the customtkinter library and to help troubleshoot the code.
AI impacted our functions, as we asked it to troubleshoot those functions for us.
We also used [Google Gemini 3 Fast] to come up with recipe names and speed up the process of finding 50+ recipes
